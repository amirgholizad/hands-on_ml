# Machine Learning Exercises - Hands-On ML by Aurélien Géron

This repository contains my solutions and exercises from the book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron.

## Structure

Each chapter has its own section inside the `main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with my code implementations and notes.

## Getting Started

To run the exercises, you will need to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
